# Mathematical Modeling and Python Simulation of Biomedical Processes

This project explores key mathematical models used in biology and medicine through Python implementations and numerical simulations. Core topics include:

Gompertzian tumor growth model — simulating sigmoidal, decelerating growth typical of many solid tumors, with analysis of growth rates, carrying capacity, and potential therapy impacts.
Two-compartment pharmacokinetic model — modeling drug distribution and elimination between central (blood/plasma) and peripheral (tissues) compartments, including parameter estimation and concentration-time profiles.
SIR epidemiological model — classic compartmental modeling of infectious disease spread, including basic reproduction number (R₀), epidemic curves, and intervention effects (e.g., vaccination or quarantine).
Cardiovascular response during exercise — dynamic models of heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, or oxygen uptake kinetics using differential equations fitted to physiological data.

All models are implemented using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy (for ODE solving with odeint), and Matplotlib (for visualization of time courses, phase planes, and sensitivity analyses). The project demonstrates how differential equations capture real-world biomedical phenomena, enabling prediction, parameter fitting, and comparison of model behaviors.
