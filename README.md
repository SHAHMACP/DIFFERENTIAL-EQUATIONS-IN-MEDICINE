# Differential Equations in Medicine

This repository explores how **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** are used to model and solve real-life medical problems, including tumor growth, diabetes, drug absorption, and cardiovascular dynamics.

## üìö Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](./Introduction.md)
2. [Chapter 1: Growth and Decay](./Chapters/Chapter1_Growth_and_Decay/)
3. [Chapter 2: Health and Environment](./Chapters/Chapter2_Health_and_Environment/)
4. [Chapter 3: Pharmacokinetics](./Chapters/Chapter3_Pharmacokinetics/)

## üß† Overview

Differential equations provide a powerful tool to model the dynamics of biological systems. This project includes:

- Malthusian and logistic growth models
- Mathematical models for tumor progression
- Applications in diabetes detection and epidemiology
- Pharmacokinetic models for drug dosing

## üìÇ How to Use

- Navigate through each chapter folder to explore specific medical models.
- Some sections contain Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) to simulate the models.
- Visuals and mathematical derivations are included in the `.md` files.
