# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity, and arrangement. Its applications involve the study of the physical, biological, and sociological world. Prior to this project, we explored the topic **"Applications of Differential Equations in Medicine."**

Differential equations can be used to explain and predict new facts about systems that change continuously. Examples include the orbit of a spaceship, the amount of money in a savings account, deformation of elastic structures, the description of radio waves, biological population size, and more.

Differential equations originate whenever a universal law of nature is expressed in terms of a mathematical variable and at least one of its derivatives. Interestingly, the birth of differential equations is traced to **November 11, 1675**, when *Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz* used integral calculus for the first time to find the area under a graph using the symbols âˆ« and **dy**.

Differential equations are a powerful mathematical means to describe the natural world. Many scientific laws involve rates at which things occur. To model these mathematically, we write **equations involving derivatives**. The standard modeling process involves:

1. Data collection  
2. Building a mathematical model  
3. Solving the model and comparing it to real-world observations

The history of mathematics in biomedical sciences dates back to **1798**, when *Thomas Malthus* proposed his law of human population growth. Later, the *logistic growth model* by *Verhulst* became foundational in population dynamics.

In this project, we examine mathematical models used in **oncology, cardiology, epidemiology, and pathology** to showcase how mathematics enriches diverse areas of medicine:

- **Tumor Growth Models** demonstrate the relationship between tumor size and time.
- **Epidemiological Models** address the occurrence and control of contagious diseases.
- **Pharmacokinetic Models** describe drug behavior in the body using systems of linear or nonlinear ODEs.
- **Diabetes Models** explore glucose regulation in the human body.
- **Cardiovascular Models** predict heart rate and blood pressure changes during exercise stress.

Mathematics is currently experiencing a resurgence in the field of medicine. At the same time, it draws inspiration and development from medicine, biology, psychology, economics, and other social sciences.

This paper presents a concise overview of **ODE modeling frameworks** and provides practical examples of how **Ordinary Differential Equations** can help solve real-world problems in medicine.
