## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The study of **differential equations** is a fundamental area in both pure and applied mathematics, with wide-ranging applications in **physics, engineering**, and increasingly in **medicine**.

* **Pure mathematics** focuses on the theoretical aspectsâ€”such as existence and uniqueness of solutionsâ€”while
* **Applied mathematics** emphasizes methods for approximating solutions and validating models with real-world data.

This project explores the breadth and depth of mathematical methods currently used in medicine, particularly in:

* **Oncology**
* **Cardiology**
* **Epidemiology**
* **Pharmacokinetics**

Mathematics has become an essential tool in addressing key medical challenges, such as:

* Cardiovascular diseases
* Clinical test scheduling
* Drug design and delivery
* Disease spread and control
* Genetic modeling

Each chapter of this study illustrates how diverse mathematical disciplines contribute to modeling and analyzing complex biological systems. The following areas are addressed:

* Growth and decay of biological systems (e.g., cell or organ development)
* Tumor dynamics and immune system interactions
* Disease transmission modeling (e.g., SIR models in epidemiology)
* Cardiovascular response to stress or exercise
* Detection models for chronic diseases like diabetes
* Drug absorption and distribution (single and multi-compartment models in pharmacokinetics)

ðŸ“Œ **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** provide a classical and powerful framework for modeling temporal dynamics in biological systems.

> **Qualitative analysis** of these models often yields deep biological insights that may not be visible through experiments alone.

Through this exploration, students and readers are encouraged to not only solve differential equations but also:

* Interpret the results biologically,
* Apply mathematical reasoning to real-world health problems,
* And improve their ability to communicate mathematical ideas effectively.
